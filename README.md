AeroAnalyzer Pro v1.4AeroAnalyzer Pro is a high-performance, GPU-accelerated wind tunnel simulator designed for real-time aerodynamic analysis of 3D geometries. Built with Electron and Three.js, it allows designers and engineers to instantly evaluate the downforce and efficiency of their models.🚀 Key FeaturesGPU-Accelerated BVH: Utilizes Bounding Volume Hierarchy (via three-mesh-bvh) for lightning-fast collision detection, enabling smooth simulation of complex meshes with 100k+ polygons.Automated Geometry Analysis: No manual input required. The engine automatically calculates:Frontal Area (A): Real-time 3D bounding box projection.Lift Coefficient ($C_l$): Derived from surface normal analysis at collision points.Real-time Telemetry: Instant feedback on Downforce (Newtons) and Weight Equivalent (kg) as you scale, rotate, or move the model.Multi-format Support: Native support for .STL, .OBJ, and .GLTF files.Interactive Streamlines: Dynamic particle trails that reflect off surfaces and change color based on pressure and velocity.🛠 Tech StackCore: Three.js (WebGL)Desktop Wrapper: ElectronPhysics/Collision: three-mesh-bvhUI: Modern CSS Glassmorphism📐 The PhysicsThe simulation calculates downforce based on the standard aerodynamic lift equation:$$L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 A C_l$$Where:$\rho$ (Rho) is air density ($1.225 \text{ kg/m}^3$).$v$ is velocity (Wind Speed).$A$ is the automatically detected Frontal Area.$C_l$ is the calculated Lift Coefficient.💻 Installation & SetupClone the repository:Bashgit clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AeroAnalyzer.git
